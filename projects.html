					<h3><b>Tunable Communication for Distributed Systems</b></h3>
					<p>
                        <i>(Spring 2025 - Present)</i>
						At Brown, I am building a communication layer for distributed
						systems. This system has two main contributions:
						<br />
						1) By fitting the guarantees provided by the communication layer to
						the exact needs of the distributed system, we are able to improve
						the performance of the system.<br />
						2) Our abstraction allows a developer to cleanly and rapidly specify
						the communication pattern they want for their distributed system.
						<br />
						My distributed communication abstraction, Tundra, utilizes DPDK for
						low-latency networking, and has the ability to switch this backend
						to kernel sockets or a virtualized debugging interface.

					<h3><b>RDMA Data Structures</b></h3>
					<p>
                        <i>(Fall 2023 - Summer 2024)</i>
						In my undergraduate, I built concurrent data structures using
						one-sided RDMA. In total, I implemented three novel designs of a
						B+Tree, skiplist, and an IHT (Inter-locked hashtable). I also
						designed a software-cache for one-sided RDMA that enabled a
						high-performance design by optimizing the read-heavy traversals of
						the tree-like indexes in the B+Tree, skiplist, and IHT.
